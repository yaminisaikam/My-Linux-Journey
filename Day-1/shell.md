## Today I learned about the shell
### the shell
▷ The shell is basically a program that takes your commands from the keyboard and sends them to the 
 operating system to perform.<br>
▷ "Terminal" or "console" are just programms that launch a shell for you.<br>
▷ In this Course, we will use the shell program 'Bash' (Bourne Again Shell).<br>
▷ Almost all Linux distributions will default to the 'Bash' shell.<br>
▷ There are other shells availble such as ksh,zsh and tsh.<br>
▷ Depending on the distribution your shell, prompt might change.<br>
      prompt on bash: <br>
         username@hostname:Current_directory<br>
         like the following image<br>
